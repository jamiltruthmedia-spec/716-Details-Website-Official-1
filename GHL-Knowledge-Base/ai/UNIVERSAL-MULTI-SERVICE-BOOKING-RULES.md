# UNIVERSAL MULTI-SERVICE BOOKING RULES

When a customer wants to book 2 or more services, use this process:

---

## THE PROCESS (ONE SERVICE AT A TIME)

### STEP 1: ACKNOWLEDGE MULTIPLE SERVICES
Customer: "I want [service 1] and [service 2]"
You: "Perfect! Let's get you booked. We'll schedule one service at a time to make sure everything fits. Let's start with your [service 1] first."

---

### STEP 2: BOOK FIRST SERVICE COMPLETELY

**Collect information:**
- Vehicle type (if needed)
- Which package they want
- Give price
- Ask what days work best

**Check availability:**
- Look at calendar to find days where the first service can fit
- ALSO check if the second service can fit on the SAME DAY after the first service
- Only offer days where BOTH services have available slots

**Offer available times:**
"I have [day] at [time] available. Does that work?"

**Get customer details:**
- Full name
- Phone number
- Zip code

**Book the appointment:**
- Select the correct calendar for this service and package
- Book it
- Confirm to customer: "Great! You're booked for [service 1] on [day] at [time] at 716 Details. Our shop is at 4689 Model City Rd, Lewiston, NY 14092."

---

### STEP 3: TRANSITION TO NEXT SERVICE

Immediately say:
"Now let's book your [service 2]."

---

### STEP 4: BOOK SECOND SERVICE

**Ask for package details:**
"Which [service 2] package would you like: [list options]?"

**Calculate the time slot:**
Based on when the first service ends, book the second service in the next available slot on the SAME DAY.

**Confirm the booking:**
"Perfect! I'll book your [service 2] for [time] on [same day]."

**Book the appointment:**
- Select the correct calendar for this service and package
- Use the SAME customer information (name, phone, zip)
- Book it
- Confirm: "Great! Your [service 2] is booked for [day] at [time]."

---

### STEP 5: FINAL CONFIRMATION

"You're all set! [Service 1] at [time] and [Service 2] at [time] on [full date] at 716 Details."

---

## CRITICAL RULES

### Rule 1: ONE AT A TIME
Never try to book multiple services simultaneously. Guide customer through one service at a time.

### Rule 2: SAME DAY ONLY
All services must be scheduled on the SAME DAY, one after another.

### Rule 3: CHECK BOTH BEFORE OFFERING
Before offering ANY time to customer for the first service, verify that:
- The first service slot is available
- The second service slot is available after it on the same day

Only offer times where BOTH services can fit.

### Rule 4: SELECT CORRECT CALENDAR
Each service and package has its own calendar. Examples:
- "Sedan Full Detail"
- "SUV 5-Seater Interior Detail"
- "Full Tint Package (Ceramic Film)"
- "Classic 1-Step Polish"
- etc.

Match the service and package to the exact calendar name.

### Rule 5: REUSE CUSTOMER INFO
After booking the first service, use the SAME name, phone, and zip code for all additional services.

### Rule 6: INTERNAL NOTES
Add a note to each booking listing all services:

```
Multi-service appointment:
- [Service 1] at [time]
- [Service 2] at [time]
- [Service 3] at [time] (if applicable)
```
