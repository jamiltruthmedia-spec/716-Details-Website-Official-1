# AI Improvement Recommendations for 716 Details

**Purpose:** Identify additional documents and files needed to help the conversation AI (text-only) better understand the business, answer questions accurately, and successfully book appointments.

**Goal:** Create an AI that understands the full business, answers all customer questions easily/appropriately/accurately, and can book appointments without errors.

## 📋 CURRENT GAPS & WHAT WOULD HELP

### 1. **FAQs in AI-Friendly Format** ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY

**Issue:** Current FAQs.docx has markdown, emojis, and conversational trailing questions like "What type of vehicle do you have?"

**What's needed:**
- Clean, direct Q&A format
- No conversational follow-ups embedded in answers
- Simple language
- Explicit answers (not implied)

---

### 2. **Booking Process Document** ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY

**What's needed:**
- Required information checklist (must collect before booking)
- Disqualification criteria (when NOT to book)
- Minimum notice requirements (can we do same-day? how far in advance?)
- Mobile service requirements (water access, power needed, driveway space)
- Shop booking vs mobile booking rules
- What to do if customer's preferred time is unavailable

---

### 3. **Common Mistakes & "DO NOT" List** ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY

**What's needed:**
- Explicit "DO NOT" statements:
  - Don't promise same-day if not confirmed available
  - Don't guess on pricing for unusual vehicles
  - Don't book outside 30-mile service area
  - Don't offer services we don't provide
  - Don't make up availability
  - Don't skip collecting required info

---

### 4. **Objection Handling Guide**

**What's needed:**
- Price objection responses ("That's too expensive")
- Competitor comparisons ("Why not Mister Car Wash?")
- Delay tactics ("I need to think about it")
- Scope creep ("Can you also detail my garage?")
- Discount requests ("Do you have any deals?")

---

### 5. **Vehicle Type Clarification Guide**

**Issue:** AI might struggle to categorize vehicles correctly for pricing

**What's needed:**
- How to determine sedan vs SUV vs XL
- Common vehicle examples by category (e.g., "Honda Civic = Sedan, Tesla Model X = SUV 5-Seater")
- Edge cases (Is a Jeep Wrangler a sedan or SUV? What about a Subaru Crosstrek?)
- How to handle "I don't know what size my car is"

---

### 6. **Service Area & Travel Rules**

**What's needed:**
- Exact 30-mile radius boundaries (cities at the edge)
- Areas you DON'T serve
- Any travel fees or minimum requirements
- Mobile service restrictions (only certain services available mobile)
- In-shop only services (ceramic coating, paint correction, window tinting)

---

### 7. **Availability & Scheduling Rules**

**What's needed:**
- How far in advance to book (minimum/maximum)
- Same-day emergency criteria (when it's possible vs not)
- Peak times when you're usually booked
- Seasonal considerations (busier in spring/summer?)
- Holiday closures or special hours
- Weather-related cancellations/rescheduling

---

### 8. **Escalation Triggers Document**

**When AI should say "Let me have our team call you":**
- Custom/unusual requests
- Commercial fleet pricing (needs negotiation)
- Vehicles outside normal categories
- Customer is angry or frustrated
- Technical issues with booking system
- Questions AI can't answer from knowledge base

---

### 9. **Quick Reference: Common Scenarios**

**Pre-written response templates for:**
- "How much for a detail?" (needs vehicle type first)
- "Can you come today?" (check availability protocol)
- "Do you do [unusual service]?" (how to handle)
- "I'm located in [far city]" (service area check)
- "What's the difference between packages?" (clear comparisons)

---

### 10. **Add-ons & Upsells Guide**

**What's needed:**
- What can be added to each service
- Pricing for add-ons
- When to suggest package upgrades
- Natural upsell transitions
- What NOT to upsell (don't oversell)

---

### 11. **Quality Control Checklist**

**Before completing a booking conversation, AI should verify:**
- [ ] Customer name collected
- [ ] Phone number confirmed
- [ ] Vehicle year/make/model captured
- [ ] Service type confirmed
- [ ] Price quoted and accepted
- [ ] Date and time confirmed
- [ ] Location confirmed (address for mobile, "shop" for in-shop)
- [ ] Any special requests noted
- [ ] Confirmation sent
