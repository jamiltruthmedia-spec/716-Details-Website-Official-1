## 🛡️ CERAMIC COATING

### Q: What is ceramic coating and how long does it last?
**A:** Ceramic coating is a liquid polymer that chemically bonds with your paint, creating a protective layer. Think of it as a force field for your paint.

**Benefits:**
- Lasts 3-8 years (vs. wax lasting 2-3 months)
- 10H hardness protects against scratches
- Hydrophobic - water beads off
- UV protection prevents fading
- Makes washing easier
- Enhanced gloss

Our packages start at $705 depending on vehicle size and protection level desired.

---

### Q: Can I get ceramic coating on any vehicle?
**A:** Yes! Ceramic coating works on cars, trucks, SUVs, boats, and RVs. For best results, we recommend paint correction first if your vehicle has swirls or scratches.

---

### Q: How much does ceramic coating cost?
**A:** Ceramic coating packages range from $705-$1,255 depending on:
- Vehicle size (sedan vs. SUV vs. truck)
- Protection level (3-5 year vs. 8-year warranty)
- Current paint condition

Most sedans start around $705. Call (716) 405-9988 for an exact quote based on your specific vehicle.

---

### Q: Is ceramic coating worth it?
**A:** If you plan to keep your vehicle for several years, absolutely! Here's why:
- Wax costs $50-100 every 2-3 months = $200-600/year
- Ceramic coating lasts 3-8 years for $705-$1,255 one time
